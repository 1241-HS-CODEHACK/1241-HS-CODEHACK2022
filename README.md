Robosweep is a sweeping bot which will help in self-efficiency. It is an affordable and efficient machine which is the future of robotics. It uses banana motors to sweep. In the front there is an ultrasonic sensor which senses walls/objects so that the bot does not run into them. There is also a feature of playing a beep when the work is done. One can also add detergents in the compartment given. This will make our household work easy and it is cheap. We have made robosweep on our own by using arduino (basically robotics) which moves around by detecting its surroundings using ultrasonic sensors.
